I am currently Lead Data Scientist at the Target Corporation, Minneapolis, MN.

Previously, I was an assistant professor in the ECE department at Wayne State University. I received my Ph.D. from Rice University, where I worked at the Center for Multimedia Communication.

I'm interested in all things data and probability: machine/deep learning, computer vision, (stochastic, distributed) optimization, and information theory.
