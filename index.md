I am currently Prinicpal Machine Learning Scientist for Best Buy, Minneapolis, MN.

Previously I was a Director of Artificial Intelligence for Target and assistant professor at Wayne State University. I received my Ph.D. from Rice University, where I worked at the Center for Multimedia Communication.

I'm interested in all things data and probability: machine/deep learning, computer vision and NLP, (stochastic, distributed) optimization, and information theory.

### Recent news:
- Aug 2020: New paper, "Scaling-up Distributed Processing of Data Streams for Machine Learning," accepted to the Proceedings of the IEEE. Joint work with Waheed Bajwa of Rutgers and Haroon Raja of University of Michigan. Preprint available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08854).
- Jun 2020: Pleased to announce that our work, "[Learning Furniture Compatibility with Graph Neural Networks](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPRW_2020/papers/w22/Polania_Learning_Furniture_Compatibility_With_Graph_Neural_Networks_CVPRW_2020_paper.pdf)," is accepted to CVPR Workshops. This work is with Target AI colleagues Luisa Polania-Cabrera, Mauricio Flores, and Yiran Li, and it both articulates new methods for visual compatibility and presents a new dataset for evaluating furniture compatibility.
- July 2019: Gave a tutorial talk, "An Introduction to Deep Metric Learning", for a Target-sponsored meeting of Data Science Minneapolis. Slides available [here](talks/dsm-jul-2019/#).
- June 2019: Presented "An Effective Label Noise Model for DNN Text Classification" at NAACL 2019 in Minneapolis. Joint work with former PhD student Ishan Jindal and collaborators Daniel Pressel and Brian Lester.
- May 2019: New work "A Nonlinear, Noise-aware, Quasi-clustering Approach to Learning Deep CNNs from Noisy Labels" accepted to the CVPR Workshop on Uncertainty and Robustness in Deep Learning. Work with Ishan Jindal, Daniel Pressel, and Xuwen Chen.
- May 2019: Presented "Anytime Minibatch: Exploiting Stragglers in Online Distributed Optimization" at ICLR 2019 in New Orleans. Joint work with Nuwan Ferdinand, Stark Draper, and Haider Al-Lawati at the University of Toronto.
